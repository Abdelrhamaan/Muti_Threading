    "In Python's threading module, there are two methods to execute a thread: start() and run().\n",
    "\n",
    "start(): The start() method is used to start a new thread and run its target function in parallel with the main thread. When start() is called, it initializes the thread, assigns it a new system-level thread, and invokes the thread's run() method in that separate thread. The start() method returns immediately, and the newly created thread starts executing independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "run(): The run() method is the entry point for the thread's execution. It defines the behavior of the thread and contains the code that will be executed when the thread is started. However, when you call the run() method directly, it executes the target function in the context of the current thread, without creating a new thread. In other words, it runs the thread's code in the same thread from which it was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference, consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# Thread class\n",
    "class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Thread started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of MyThread\n",
    "my_thread = MyThread()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling start() method\n",
    "my_thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling run() method\n",
    "my_thread.run()\n",
    "In this example, my_thread.start() starts a new thread that executes the run() method of MyThread in parallel with the main thread. The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Thread started\n",
    "On the other hand, my_thread.run() directly executes the run() method of MyThread in the context of the main thread. The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Thread started\n",
    "Although the output is the same in this simple example, it's important to understand that calling run() directly does not create a new thread. It simply executes the target function in the current thread, blocking the main thread until the run() method completes. In contrast, calling start() creates a new thread, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you should use the start() method to launch threads in order to achieve parallelism and take advantage of the benefits of multithreading. Calling run() directly might be useful in certain scenarios where you want to execute the thread's code synchronously within the current thread, but it does not provide the advantages of true concurrency.\n",
